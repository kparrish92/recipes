## Ingredients

### Prep

```{r, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

"Pepper",
"",
"")

Pantry = c(
"Orzo (100g)",
"Water (230ml)",
"",
"")

Fridge = c(
"Parm (50g)",
"Butter (50g)",
"Better than Bouillon Chicken Paste (if using) (1/2 tsp)",
"Hot Sauce")

1.  **Cook Orzo**: Put water into a skillet with a top. Add 1/2 tsp better than bouillon and hot sauce to taste. and salt .Try adding some celery salt next time to cut the richness of the finished product add orzo and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium/low and cover. Stir occasionally - don't let the orzo stick. The orzo should soak up (almost) all of the water. If it gets too dry and is not finished, the water might be evaportating too quickly. Just add more water and finish (this has only happened to me when I leave it uncovered too long).

2.  **Create sauce emulsion**: Add the butter and some fresh ground black pepper to the pan and let it just begin to melt. Then move the orzo and butter to a mixing bowl and stir. Add 1/3 of the Parmesan cheese and mix until it is combined. Repeat with twice to combine all cheese. Serve!
