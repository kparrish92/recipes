Total time: Like 5 minutes

Makes a small amount for dipping etc.

## Ingredients

-   150g greek yogurt (I use a single serving from an ALDI 4-pack in Germany)
-   1/2 mini cucumber (will add weight)
-   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
-   Â½ tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
-   1 tsp garlic powder
-   1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
-   1 tbsp dill
-   1/2 tsp lemon zest
-   Optional: pinch of cayenne pepper

1.  **Grate and drain cucumber**: Take your 1/2 mini cucumber and grate it through the small holes in a box grater. Put the grated cucumber on a paper towel and squeeze it well to dry it out/drain the moisture. Set the cucumber aside (or in a colander if you still feel it's too wet).

2.  **Combine and chill**: In a medium bowl, combine the all the ingredients and whisk together, add the oil last - pour it in slowly and whisk as you pour. Chill until ready to use.
